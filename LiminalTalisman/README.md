# Liminal Talisman 
### credit to izueh of nexus mods, for discovery and providing a template.
### [Talisman Quest Reward](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/111)

## todo 
Messaging is just finicky, need to enum out messages and make some templates. (Right now passing in lang to get any output for debugging)   
Adding guarenteed rolls or weights based on quest / monsters (measured in time, not difficulty)  
Adding messaging, will need to do more research as some messages just break the game and cause the hook to run twice?   
Clean up language around "points", you have village points and points from tickets.   

## pipedreams 
Talisman in reward screen (complicated but doable)
